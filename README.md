# Bluetooth

**Bluetooth** is just a small convenience that helps you building bluetooth apps faster. Don't look at it as a pod but more as a helper for you to guide through the steps of building an app like this.

For now it can't be installed, it just can be copied and that's pretty much it, it will be evolving soon, and you can help doing that too! :)
